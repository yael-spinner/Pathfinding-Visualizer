An interactive web application that allows users to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms in action. The application provides a dynamic grid where you can draw walls, move the start and end nodes, and select an algorithm to run. It's a great tool for learning and visually understanding how these algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path.

‚ú® Key Features

Visualize Three Algorithms: A* (A-Star), BFS, and Dijkstra.

Interactive Grid: Draw and erase walls by dragging the mouse.

Draggable Start & End Nodes: Place the start and end nodes anywhere on the grid.

Maze Generation: Generate a random maze with a single click using the Recursive Division 
algorithm.

Speed Control: Adjust the animation speed for a customized experience.

Modern Design: A responsive, dark-mode UI with smooth animations.


üß† Algorithms Visualized

A* (A-Star) Search: An intelligent search algorithm that uses heuristics to efficiently guide its way to the destination. It is widely considered one of the best pathfinding algorithms.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): A classic algorithm that guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of the number of steps in an unweighted grid.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: A foundational algorithm that finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph. It serves as the basis for more advanced algorithms like A*.
